TO-DO:
ws_testbed msg recieved from WSclient is in str format we need to convert to dictionary or dataframe
and code so that it ignores heartbeats and only gets candles or whatever subscription we gave it
    - will go over when kith is able to push to repository

create a data structure class called logbook, this should linked list data structure that will be able to store results of hyper
and will be able to store important trade metrics when we start trading like results of trades so we can keep track of trades
and have data for further analysis
