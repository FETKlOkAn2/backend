TO-DO:
figure out why length of product is only 848 and not 15000 available products to trade

backtrader w/ optuna for hyper optimization since vectorbt is no longer supported
PRO: has vs code extension and online dashboard 

ws_testbed msg recieved from WSclient is in str format we need to convert to dictionary or dataframe
and code so that it ignores heartbeats and only gets candles or whatever subscription we gave it
