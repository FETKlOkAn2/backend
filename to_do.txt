TO-DO:

1. Hyperparameter Optimization
You're absolutely right that hyperparameter tuning would help. Instead of brute-forcing all possible combinations (which would be time-consuming), consider using:

Bayesian Optimization: Libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt can efficiently search the parameter space
Focus on key parameters: Position sizing, confidence thresholds, and feature selection will likely have the biggest impact

2. Feature Engineering Improvements

Add market regime detection (trending vs ranging markets)
Include on-chain metrics for crypto (mempool data, wallet activity)
Add sentiment analysis from social media
Consider market correlation features (how BTC movements affect altcoins)

3. Model Enhancements

Use ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms (not just RandomForest)
Implement time-series specific models like LSTM or GRU neural networks
Consider sequence prediction instead of single-point predictions

4. Risk Management
Your current Risk_Handler class seems underutilized. I'd recommend:

Implement dynamic position sizing based on volatility
Add stop-loss and take-profit logic
Include maximum drawdown protection
Create portfolio-level risk allocation (not just per-symbol)

5. Execution Strategy

Implement smart order routing to reduce slippage
Add limit order logic instead of just market orders
Consider maker vs. taker fee optimization

6. Evaluation Metrics
Focus on risk-adjusted returns:

Sharpe/Sortino ratio optimization (not just raw returns)
Maximum drawdown minimization
Calmar ratio (return/max drawdown)

7. Market-Specific Optimizations

Add volatility-based filters (don't trade during extreme volatility)
Implement exchange-specific features (funding rates for perpetual futures)
Create separate models for different market conditions

8. Production Readiness

Add paper trading mode before live trading
Implement proper position tracking and reconciliation
Create a monitoring dashboard for performance

To implement these improvements efficiently, I would suggest starting with a more structured hyperparameter optimization framework using Optuna, then focus on improving your feature set and enhancing the risk management component.
