TO-DO:
test if we can not input close in the hyper and if it will give the same results so we dont have to send close 
to custom_indicator

put in a check when first initailize backtest that loops through the attributes possibly using dir()
puts all attributs with 'ti' as the first in a list with their values and checks to make sure they are 
a pandas Series if not then print out a statement saying that ti_data needs to be a pandas data frame
in order to graph ---- or better yet graph function convert them so that its not making a lot of pd.Series
when running hyper

program so that we can choose to only graph the ti_data such as oscilators and not close
