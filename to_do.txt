TO-DO:

fix bug in WS where we recieve imcoming message but ignore until granualirty comes

might be bug if we have more than 2 osc_data will have to test later specifically plotting entrys and exits on the graph

test if we can not input close in the hyper and if it will give the same results so we dont have to send close 
to custom_indicator

make scanner, and complete logbook class for DB
