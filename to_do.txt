TO-DO:
--- issue with volume format it is rounding example btc volume showing 4.5658 this should be millions but a lower volume coin shows 16.52 and it is only 1,652 this will be a problem later

---fix bug in WS where we recieve imcoming message but ignore until granualirty comes

---might be bug if we have more than 2 osc_data will have to test later specifically plotting entrys and exits on the graph
