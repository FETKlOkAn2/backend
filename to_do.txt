TO-DO:
--- error with some very big int, too big for sqlite might need to put them into string format and then when we
    retrieve them conver them into integers

---fix bug in WS where we recieve imcoming message but ignore until granualirty comes

---might be bug if we have more than 2 osc_data will have to test later specifically plotting entrys and exits on the graph
